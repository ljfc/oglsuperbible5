# Code from OpenGL SuperBible 5th Ed.

Initially exported from code.google.com/p/oglsuperbible5

This is an attempt to get the code from OGL SB 5th Ed (2011) compiling on OSX 10.11.

Iâ€™m using the 5th edition because my understanding is that Apple does not provide more modern versions of OpenGL than 3.x covered in this book. However, this also means that the build instructions provided in the book itself are out of date.

Currently I am not aiming to get all the code working. Initially I will just get GLTools working so that someone could link it into their own versions of the tutorials from the book.
